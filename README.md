# IQCb
Classification Quality Indicator for sets of binary data


Data classification is a data mining task that consists in adjusting parameters of an algorithm by a training dataset that is used to infer the class of an (unclassified) object under analysis. A significant part of the classification algorithm's performance depends on the dataset's complexity and quality. 

Data Complexity involves the investigation of the effects of dimensionality, the overlap of descriptive attributes, and the classes' separability. Data Quality, as far as it is concerned, focuses on aspects such as noise and missing values. 

This project applies Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) algorithm and presents a composite indicator, called Classification Quality Indicator for sets of binary data (IQCb), which associates the contributions of Data Complexity and Data Quality to Classification Quality. 

An experimental modeling is applied to 178 datasets obtained from the OpenML repository.
